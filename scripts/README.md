I use these script to build the help, keep StickFigure.pde in sync, and ensure all the sketches run OK in some different flavors of Processing.

# Prerequisites

* [php](http://php.net/)
* The [javadoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javadoc) command (part of the [JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html))
* One or more versions of the [Processing](https://processing.org/)

Then modify config.php to reflect where Processing is installed on your system, and where any web-browsers you'd like to test with are installed.
